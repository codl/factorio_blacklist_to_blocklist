# Blacklist to Blocklist

A simple text replacement mod for Factorio. Replaces "Blacklist" with "Blocklist" and "Whitelist" with "Allowlist"

The mod can be found [on the mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/blacklist_to_blocklist).

![In an example screenshot, the UI for a filter inserter shows a toggle between "Allowlist" and "Blocklist".](https://assets-mod.factorio.com/assets/fc43f893dcbe0596822fcdc55536daea026d78eb.png)

## Caveat emptor

This mod cannot rename the `/whitelist` command. It does add a placeholder `/allowlist` command that reminds the player to use `/whitelist` instead.
